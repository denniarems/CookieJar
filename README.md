#Bake different types of cookies

When cookies are baked, a name should also be be given based on what cookie it is.
A cookiejar for a user should support keeping multiple types of cookies at a time.
ie A cookiejar might have ‘chocolate chip cookies’ with count 5 and ‘gingerbread’ with count 2
Cookie counts of a type should be incremented when cookies of same types are baked again
Count should show the count of all the cookies currently in a users cookie jar
#Transfer cookies from one user to another

User should be able to transfer any of his cookies (from all the different types that he has in the
